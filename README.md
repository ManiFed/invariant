## How can I deploy this project?

### Deploy to Railway

This repo now includes a `railway.toml` and a production `npm start` command so Railway can build and serve the Vite app automatically.

1. Create a new Railway project and connect this repository.
2. Railway will run `npm ci && npm run build` during build.
3. Railway will run `npm run start`, which now uses a lightweight Node static server (`server.mjs`) to serve `dist/` on `0.0.0.0:$PORT` without requiring Vite at runtime.

### Deploy via Lovable

Simply open [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID) and click on Share -> Publish.
